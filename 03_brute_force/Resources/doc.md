# Brute Force

Just do a simple script that tries to login with the admin user, using most common passwords.

# How to prevent it
To prevent brute force attacks, you can rate limit the number of login attempts from a single IP address. You can also use CAPTCHA to prevent automated login attempts.

Of course, you can also use strong passwords and two-factor authentication to make it harder for attackers to guess the password.
